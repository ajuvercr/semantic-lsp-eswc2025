SWLS is not static software: its extensible design ensures that new features and improvements can be easily incorporated. 
The current implementation provides a robust foundation for further exploration of user needs and iterative enhancement.

For examples,
users that interact with ComponentsJS (CJS) configurations have a difficult time\cite{CJS}, often checking the correctness of their configuration at runtime.
Normal JSON-LD editors have difficulties to handle CJS configuration because of the used Linked Software Dependencies\cite{CJS2}, that should be resolved to the local \texttt{node\_modules} folders.
By adding two things to SWLS, CJS users can use the same powerful IDE support as other semantic web developers.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Add a new way to resolve JSON-LD contexts, by looking for the write configuration files in the \texttt{node\_modules}.
  \item Derive properties from CJS component definitions
  \item Validate configuration by using the checking if all parameters are defined and have the correct range.

\end{enumerate}
