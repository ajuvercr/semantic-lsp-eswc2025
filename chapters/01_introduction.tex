% Enhancing semantic web adoption by lowering the barrier to learn (ref Two Decades On)
% In this paper we introduce Semantic LSP, a language server to bring enhanced editing linked data documents, including turtle, jsonld and sparql.

% Focus not only on semantic engineers, people that work daily with semantic data
% But also focus on data engineers that create intriguing sparql queries over the precious semantic data
% Focus also on the domain experts, sometimes installing extra software is too big a hurdle
% These people we call 'end users' (cite  10.1145/1922649.1922658)

% End users should focus on the following steps
% - Requirements: How the software should behave in the world
% - Design and specifications: How the software behaves internally to achieve the requirements
% - Reuse: Using preexisting code to save time and avoid errors (including integration, extension, and other perfective maintenance)
% - Testing and Verification: Gaining confidence about correctness and identifying failures.
% - Debugging: Repairing known failures by locating and correcting errors.
% Language servers help the end user with design and reuse by bringing autocompletion to the editor. 
% Design is more fluent for the domain experts because writing OWL and RDFS is faster and less error prone.
% Reuse is stimulated by already suggesting defined properties when writing turtle.
% Testing and verification is enhanced by using SHACL shapes to valide user data on the fly and ensuring correct syntax.

% A language server also serves to lowering the barrier to active learning. Users in the study ... et al attested to the complexity of creating sparql queryies for wikidata.
% Autocompletion on properties and suggesting properties with plain texts help the students explore the ontology and lets them create more intriguing queries.


% There is already a lot of related work, even in the area of the semantic web (cite yasgui).
% Yasgui showed that lowering the barrier to entry indeed does encourage more usage and raised the semantic literacie quite quickly.
% We believe that taking those concepts and expanding on them to support more semantic languages and focussing on a easy to use design that promotes extensibily is a great oportunity to advance the state of the art.


The semantic web has matured over the past two decades, yet its adoption remains limited due to significant barriers to usability and accessibility \cite{10.3233/SW-190387}. 
Complexities in working with semantic languages like Turtle, JSON-LD, and SPARQL, coupled with a lack of intuitive tooling, make it challenging for users across varying levels of expertise to effectively create, manage, and query semantic data. 
To address these challenges, we introduce Semantic LSP, a language server designed to enhance the editing experience for linked data documents. 
By leveraging features such as autocompletion, diagnostics, and real-time validation, Semantic LSP aims to lower the barriers to semantic web adoption while improving productivity and reducing common errors.

The need for such a tool becomes evident when considering the distinct challenges faced by key user groups:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Semantic Power Users}\\
    Experienced semantic engineers require advanced tools to efficiently manage large datasets, develop ontologies, and perform reasoning tasks.
    While proficient, even these users benefit from features that reduce cognitive overhead, minimize manual errors, and accelerate routine operations.
    Tools like Semantic LSP provide real-time feedback, context-aware autocompletion, and error diagnostics, significantly streamlining their workflows.

  \item \textbf{Newcomers and Casual Users}\\
    Beginners, including students and hobbyists, often struggle with the intricacies of semantic technologies\cite{EvensteinSigalov2023,Turki2021RepresentingCI}. 
    Writing valid RDF documents or crafting correct SPARQL queries can be overwhelming without proper guidance. 
    Semantic LSP supports active learning by offering user-friendly features such as syntax highlighting, contextual autocompletion, and hover-based documentation, empowering newcomers to experiment confidently and overcome the steep learning curve.


\item \textbf{Domain Experts Creating Ontologies}\\
    Domain experts typically rely on tools like Protégé for ontology creation. 
    However, such tools can introduce bottlenecks, particularly for smaller projects, due to setup complexity and steep learning curves. 
    Semantic LSP offers a lightweight alternative by enabling ontology creation directly within text editors using Turtle.
    This approach is especially beneficial for quick iterations and avoids the overhead of additional software installation and configuration.

  \item \textbf{Data Engineers Crafting SPARQL Queries}\\
    Data engineers frequently face challenges in exploring unfamiliar ontologies and writing sophisticated queries. 
    Semantic LSP facilitates these tasks with intelligent autocompletion, which suggests properties and classes based on context, and hover-based explanations that help users understand ontology structures.
    These features reduce errors, improve query quality, and promote deeper engagement with semantic data.
\end{enumerate}

Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are widely recognized for their ability to improve developer productivity, streamline workflows, and reduce common mistakes across various domains \cite{javaEngineer}. 
Features like syntax highlighting and diagnostics are not merely conveniences; they are essential tools for ensuring accuracy and maintaining consistency. 
Despite these benefits, such productivity-enhancing features are underrepresented in semantic web tooling.
Semantic LSP bridges this gap, extending the advantages of modern IDEs to semantic web technologies.

Previous efforts, such as YASGUI for SPARQL query editing, have shown the value of lowering entry barriers by improving usability \cite{10.3233/SW-150197,10.1007/978-3-642-41242-4_7}. 
Semantic LSP builds on these successes, expanding support to multiple semantic languages and emphasizing a user-friendly, extensible design. 
By addressing the unique needs of these user groups, we aim to advance the state of the art in semantic web tooling and encourage broader adoption.
