\section{Preliminaries}%
\label{sec:preliminaries}
Since we defined $\mappingInst$ as a multiset, there is a
notion of cardinalities of the mapping tuples~$\mappingTuple$ inside
$\mappingInst$.


\begin{definition}
	\label{def:cardinality}
	Given a cardinality function $\card$.
	The cardinality function~$\card$ applied on a mapping
	tuple~$\mappingTuple$, in a multiset of mapping tuples~$\mappingInst$, as
	$\fctCard{\mappingInst}{\mappingTuple}$, gives us the number of occurrences
	of mapping tuple~$\mappingTuple$ in
	$\mappingInst$.
\end{definition}


Naturally, when we restrict the domain of the mapping tuple~$\mappingTuple$ in
the multiset~$\mappingInst$, as defined in Definition~\ref{def:tuple_restrict},
there can be a change in the cardinality of the resulting mapping
tuple~$\mappingTuple'$ as an element of the resulting multiset of mapping
tuples~$\mappingInst'$.
This change in the cardinality can be calculated as follows:

\begin{property}
	\label{prop:cardinality_restriction}
	Given a multiset of mapping tuples~$\mappingInst$ and its corresponding cardinality
	function~$\card$, a set of attributes $A$ and $P \subseteq (A
		\setminus \{\fragAttr\})$ where all mapping tuples~$\mappingTuple$ in
	$\mappingInst$ has the domain $A$.
	Restricting all the mapping tuples~$\mappingTuple$ in $\mappingInst$ to the
	attributes $P \cup \{\fragAttr\}$ such that the restricted mapping tuples
	$\mappingTuple' = \mappingTuple[P \cup \{\fragAttr\}]$ forms the multiset
	of restricted mapping tuples called~$\mappingInst'$.
    The cardinality function, $\card'$, applied on mapping
    tuple~$\mappingTuple'$, $\card'(\mappingTuple')$, is the summation of
    $\card(\mappingTuple)$ for all $\mappingTuple \in \mappingInst$ such that
    $\mappingTuple[P \cup \{\fragAttr\}]  = \mappingTuple'$, \break (i.e,
    $\card(\mappingTuple') = \sum\limits_{\mappingTuple \in \mappingInst}
    \card(t) \ | \ \mappingTuple[P \cup \{\fragAttr\}] = \mappingTuple'$). 
\end{property}
